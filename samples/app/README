This folder contains an example on how to build a Venster application
as a complete standalone windows application.
The venster application 'sampleapp.py' will be distributed as an .exe
by using py2exe (http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/).
The installer will be created by using NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/).

Steps:
1. Make sure that you have installed venster and ctypes
2. Install py2exe and NSIS 
3. Update the make.bat file in this directory if you have changed the default installed location of NSIS
4. Run the make.bat file in this folder
5. The sampleapp.installer.exe has been created.
