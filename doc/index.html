<h1>&nbsp;Venster</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Venster is a highly native Windows GUI toolkit for Python based on the ctypes ffi library.
</p>
<p>The aim of Venster is to be a very lightweight wrapper around the standard Win32 API, making it easy to write slick windows applications in pure Python.</p>
</p>
<p>
Please note that Venster is currently alpha code, and it is provided to get feedback from
the Windows and Python developer communities.
</p>
<p>
Despite being alpha, it is also already very useful and can certainly be used to succesfully create native windows programs in Python.
<br/>Combine Venster with <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/">py2exe</a> to create windows executables and
<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/">NSIS</a> to create an installer, and you have a great way to deliver Python programs to your users
on the Windows platform.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/venster/sampleapp.installer.exe?download">Click on this link to download an example of a Windows application created with Venster.</a>
<p>
This example shows that Venster can be used to create standalone Windows applications in Python with minimal runtime requirements.
<br/>Everything is included within the 800Kb package and the program can be installed on any Windows machine with no additional downloads.
</p>
<p>
Venster is an open source library and is hosted at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/venster/">Sourceforge</a>.

<h3>Installing Venster</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Installing venster; first download and install the latest ctypes package (select the installer .exe for your Python version) from <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71702">here</a>
,<br/>Then download the latest source distribution (.zip file) of Venster from <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=79630">here</a>

</p></li>
<li>
<p>
&nbsp;Unpack the Venster zip file in some folder; and issue a <span class="cmd">python setup.py install</span> in that folder.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
&nbsp;The venster distribution contains a subfolder <span class="cmd">test</span> which contains some samples on how to use Venster.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
&nbsp;<span class="cmd">test_app.pyw</span> is an example of a typical explorer style windows program:
<p>
<img src="application.png">
</p>
It uses the windows <span class="cmd">TreeView</span> and <span class="cmd">TabControl</span> Common Controls.
It also hosts the <span class="cmd">Internet Explorer Control</span>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
&nbsp;Another example is <span class="cmd">test_coolbar</span>:
<p>
<img src="coolbar.png">
</p>
This example shows the use of a <span class="cmd">Toolbar</span> Common Control with a menu. This is a
very sleek UI feature that was first introduced by Internet Explorer.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
