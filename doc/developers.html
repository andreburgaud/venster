<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Abstracts some of the more anoying details of the win32 API. (but not all):<p>
<ol>
<li><p>The mapping from Win32 handles to real python instances of
	  a python Window class.</p><p>The abstraction is not 100%. Window messages are connected
to python methods trough the use of MSG_MAPS.</p>
	  I don't mind working with Msg Maps. If you would abstract these away
	  using some elaborate signal/slot/listener/bla mechanism, 10 to 1 that someday (sooner
	  rather than later) you would still have to deal with the gory details of Global Wnd Procs
	  and such anyway. 
	  
	  This is mostly implemented by using a global python dict which maps between HWNDS and 
instances
		(changed to WeakDict)

	  Msg cracking/routing is now handled trough a MSG_MAP class, different type of 'handlers'
	  are defined for processing Notification msgs, Command msg and normal WM_* msgs</p></li>

<li><p>
	  Garbage collection. Most windows widgets (windows, menus, etc etc) have some CreateXXX
	  method and some special DestroyXXX method.
	  I would like these to be called automatically by the framework.
	  
	  This is not implemented yet, I've made a 'disposable' base class of which all things
	  with handles are derived. All derived classes implement a __dispose__(self) method
	  which calls the apropriate windows DestroyXXX function to release the handle.
</p></li>
	  
	  
<li><p>
	  Automatic Layout management. This is really lacking in the Windows API. It would be nice
	  to have. (see Swing for Java, it really works there).	  </p></li>
	   
</ol>

<p>Bases on the above a small library of more 'high level' controls is being developed. These controls
go beyond what the standard windows controls provide. in order to make them a little bit more 'pythonic'</p>
 

<h3>Source layout</h3>
<p>The top level package 'venster' contains the low level windows abstractions:</p>
<el>
<li><span class="cmd">windows.py</span> Contains windows constants and functions from user32.dll, the main windows gui library</li>
<li><span class="cmd">wtl.py</span> Contains the main Venster abstraction of 'Window', maps between  python Windows and Win32 HANDLE's. This module also implements Message cracking/routing, defines handlers for normal WM_* msgs, WM_NOTIFY notification messages and WM_COMMAND msgs. Also contains basic specialisations of Window for 'Menu', 'Bitmap', 'Icon' and 'Font'</li>
<li><span class="cmd">comdlg.py</span> Common Controls base library, based on wtl.py Window abstraction. Wraps the standard windows Common Controls (TreeView, ListView etc)</li>

</el>
<p>The 'venster.lib' package contains the more high level stuff:</p
<el>
<li><span class="cmd">form.py</span> A form style main window. Automatically keeps track of other frame windows, closes the app  when last form is closed</li>
<li><span class="cmd">notebook.py</span> A 'Notebook' control. This is based on the TabControl common control. I contains some hacks to reduce the TabControl's flicker. It automatically hides and unhides the tab panes</li>
<li><span class="cmd">tree.py</span> Extended from TreeView common control. Contains some extra methods to make it more pythonic</li>
<li><span class="cmd">list.py</span> Extended from ListView common control. Contains some extra methods to make it more pythonic</li>
<li><span class="cmd">splitter.py</span> A usefull  window splitter class (Windows does not have this, so every toolkit needs its own)</li>
